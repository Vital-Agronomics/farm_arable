# Farm Arable

This module integrates the [Arable Mark] with [farmOS].

This module provides an `arable` data stream type that be configured with
Sensor assets. A default `apikey` can be configured and used with all sensors
or a unique `apikey` can be saved with individual sensors. See the
[API Key Docs] for info on creating an Arable API key.

See the [Arable Developer Docs] and [Arable API v2 Docs] for more info on integrating with the
